# Pick


This project is one window app, trying to make user experience, smooth and easy.  
Of course that wouldn't happen without good user interface.  
Since the project about food, so it's good to be colorful.

1. I start with main, the main includes two clickable sections.
2. The two sections is PICK YOUR INGREDIENTS and ORDER NOW
3. The PICK YOUR INGREDIENTS is opening menu from the right side.
4. In the right side, I added filtering products, adding products to bag, which is submenu from parent menu.
5. And increase decrease delete buttons, and count and total count.
6. The ORDER NOW is opening menu from the left side.
7. The right side about choosing your ingredients.
8. The left side about form validation
9. At wide-screen over 1400px, the both sides is open, and no need to click.
10. Finally in the footer, I add some animations and small image slider, showing available fresh products.
11. Last but not least, if there is any mistakes, of course will be updated.
